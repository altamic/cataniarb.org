why the lucky stiff

Hello why, I am a rubyst from the sunny Catania, Italy and I love products of your mind. 
My heart exhorts me daily to show ruby wonderland to my buddies, but my worst fault is to lazily  follow my heart. One day I gave up and I've established a so-called Ruby Local User Group. 
Things are going fine here: Ruby primers, Shoes on the beach etc ...

The point now is that some guys know whys. What whys? --you may ask. I mean some of them know why rubyland is better and some others know about why, the lucky stiff. For the latter group it would be awesome to feature you in an interview. 

I know you're quite busy at the moment and you may wonder how I have the face to ask a stupid interview. You're right. To overcome a such hairy issue I decide to pose only 3 questions, because, you know, the lesser the better.

1) Hello, why you're the author of the awesome poignant guide to ruby 

2) 

3)

Thank you why,

Michelangelo 

P.S.: You saved my life as well.
